This project is a monitoring system for the monuments. It registers users via Aadhar card or passport or any other government id proofs. When user wants to visit any monument, user just selects the monument then registers in a specific time slot.

At the monument we have applied facial recognition to identify the person to increase the security of the place. This will be extended to use beacon along with facial recognition inside the monument to track suspicious behaviour.
