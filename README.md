# Monuments Security System

About the project

This project is a monitoring system for the monuments. It registers users via Aadhar card or passport or any other government photo id proof. When a user wants to visit any monument, user just selects the monument then registers in a specific time slot and then his/her record is saved in local database of the monument for authentication from government's database.

At the monument we have applied facial recognition to authenticate the visiter at the entrance and also check his/her identity in police records in order to increase the security of the monument. This project will be extended to use beacon along with a unique RFID for each visitor inside the monument to track suspicious behaviour and give useful information about various points inside the monument.

Project started at Rastrapati Bhavan , President House , India on March 19,2016.
